This free pattern bank was designed as a gateway to yarn crafts for makers of all ages and experience. Purlwise allows you to tailor your search query by pattern type, yarn weight, and clothing type. Patterns that appear will always be free and at a novice level, which you may save to your user profile for future projects.
